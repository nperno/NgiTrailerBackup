#About
This is a small, sample application which uses GM NGI vehicle data to estimate the direction of a trailer backing up. The app will show an image of the direction of the trailer based on steering wheel angle.

THIS APP IS FOR DEMO USE ONLY AND IS NOT INTENDED TO BE USED IN AN ACTUAL VEHICLE.

#Getting Started
To start, install GM NGI from: https://developer.gm.com/ngi and execute:

ngi serve

#Testing
To test, adjust the wheel_angle value from the "signal panel" toolbar.
Testing my branch.

#TODO

1. Create a function to convert C to F (maybe auto detect what the car is using?)
2. Auto detect backup (switch between backup screen and the last screen you were on)
3. Auto detech if trailer wiring is connect
4. detect tow haul mode?
